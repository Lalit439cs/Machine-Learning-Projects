# Machine-Learning-Projects
There are many machine learning projects ranging from classical models to Neural Networks

## 1. Judging a Book by its Cover  
• Build Neural Network Architectures ,**CNNs and RNNs on image(Book cover image) and text(Book title)
dataset of Books**, to predict the book genre amongst 30 possible categories<br>
• Implemented own CNNs and RNNs models using **PyTorch** ,for this classification task.<br>
• Used **BERT (for text dataset)** and **EfficientNetB4 (for image dataset)**.For this Multimodal,combined (by
Stacking) probabilities obtained from these models and then used **SVM Classifier** to get accuracy of **63.4%**<br>

**Note:** This project was created collaboratively by Lalit Meena and Prakul Virdi during COL774, Machine Learning course(Fall 2022,Prof. Parag Singla).
